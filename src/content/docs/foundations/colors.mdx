A timeless concept that is inspired by the **colors** and **diversity** of **the nature**.
The nature never grows old, it adapts, transforms and evolves but it always keeps its unique and enchanting charm.

Colors play a crucial role in communicating status, guidance, and providing visual cues. Color should be used sparingly to drive focus to moments that matter. Color should not be used to add personality or flair.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Accessibility: Always ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to maintain readability.
2. Balance: Use vibrant colors sparingly to create focal points and guide user attention.
3. Harmony: Combine colors from our palette to create cohesive and visually appealing designs.

Creating the design system concept based on minimalism is not only about the visual design but also about the underlying principles that guide the design process. It's essential to communicate both the visual aspects and the philosophy behind minimalism.

These principles serve as a foundation for every aspect of the design system:
- **Simplicity**: At its core, minimalism is about simplifying design to its essential elements. This means removing any unnecessary or extraneous details and focusing on what truly matters. In the design system, this principle guides the choice of a limited and neutral color palette, clean and legible typefaces, and streamlined user interface components.
- **Clarity**: Minimalism prioritizes clarity in communication. In the context of a design system, this means creating an interface that is easy for users to understand and navigate. A clean layout, uncluttered pages, and a straightforward visual hierarchy contribute to this clarity.
- **Functionality**: Minimalism emphasizes the importance of design serving a clear purpose. In the design system, every element, from buttons to images, should have a well-defined function. Superfluous elements that don't enhance the user experience are omitted.
- **Reduction of Non-essential Elements**: This is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of minimalism. In the design system, it means removing anything that doesn't contribute to the user's goals. Unnecessary embellishments, excessive decoration, or complex features are omitted, creating a minimalist interface that's free from distractions.
